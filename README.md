## Introduction

The Core Ontology of Phenotyping (COP) defines core entities and their relationships that are relevant for modelling phenotypic knowledge and developing phenotyping software. The COP is founded on [GFO-light](https://github.com/Onto-Med/gfo-light).

**Figure 1. COP (overview)**

*A run of a phenotyping software (implementing a phenotype algorithm) realises a phenotyping process, i.e., identifies individuals with certain phenotypes (traits or characteristics). Phenotype algorithms describe the execution of phenotype queries, which are based on phenotype models consisting of phenotype class views, which represent phenotype classes instantiated by phenotypes. Phenotype class views consist of attribute specifications (such as title, data type, unit of measure, terminology code, derivation expression, value range, etc.).*

## References

The ontology was initially named the Core Ontology of Phenotypes. However, its scope was later expanded, prompting a name change. You may encounter references using the older name.
